# To-Do-Management-System
This system organizes tasks to help you stay focused, remember everything and complete goals by providing a list of priorities, reducing mental load and acting as a tool for planning and productivity.
I aim it to provide the following features;
Organise and capture tasks: It acts as a central place to record everything that needs to be done, preventing tasks from being forgotten.
Prioritise and manage: It should decide which tasks are most important or urgent.
Track progress and deadlines: It should provide an effective way to track when work is due and help ensure that important tasks are completed on time.
Improve efficiency: By having a clear plan, you can be more efficient and less distracted when working on tasks.
